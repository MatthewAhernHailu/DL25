# D&D PDF Question-Answering AI

## Description
This project builds a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model using the `flan-t5-base` language model to answer questions based on a Dungeons & Dragons PDF.

## Files
- `RAG_DnD_Project.ipynb` – main notebook
- `dnd_5e_basic_rules.pdf` – source document
- `requirements.txt` – list of required Python packages

## How to Run
1. Install packages: noted in file, and "Required packages DL.txt
2. Run the notebook cells in order.

No API keys or external services are required.

## Notes
- The model is based on Hugging Face `flan-t5-base`.
- Chunking and embeddings are handled via `langchain` and `faiss`.
